## üêß Linux Support & Troubleshooting

The game has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04. You might get lucky on other x64 Linux systems. Some troubleshooting tips added below.

### Stream Deck HID Device Permission

You might get a permission issue on the Stream Deck HID device. It will look something like this.

```
HidSharp.Exceptions.DeviceUnauthorizedAccessException: Not permitted to open HID class device at /dev/hidraw1.
```

Use the following command to take ownership of the HID device. Replace `{your_user_name}` with your user name, without the curly braces.

```bash
$ sudo chown {your_user_name}:{your_user_name} /dev/hidraw1
```

### Sound Issues

Sound might not work if you run the game using `sudo`. You might get an error message looking like this.

```bash
ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:1032:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave
```
